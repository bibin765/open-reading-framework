## Five Practical Application Prompts

1. **The Habit Audit**: List your current daily habits (both good and bad) and evaluate how they align with the identity you want to build. Which habits are helping you become the person you want to be, and which are holding you back? Create a plan to reinforce positive habits and eliminate or replace negative ones.

2. **Environmental Engineering**: Examine your living and working spaces. How can you redesign these environments to make good habits more obvious and convenient while making bad habits less accessible? Implement at least three environmental changes that support your desired behaviors.

3. **The Two-Minute Challenge**: Choose a habit you want to develop and break it down to a version that takes two minutes or less. For example, if you want to read more, start with "read one page." Practice this micro-habit for two weeks, then gradually scale it up. How does this approach change your relationship with the larger goal?

4. **Habit Stacking Implementation**: Identify a well-established habit you already do consistently (like making coffee or brushing teeth). Design a habit stack by attaching a new desired behavior to this existing habit. Track your success rate for one month. What makes habit stacking effective or challenging?

5. **Systems vs. Goals Experiment**: Take a goal you're currently working toward and shift your focus entirely to the system that would achieve that goal. Instead of focusing on losing 20 pounds, focus on the system of eating healthy meals and exercising regularly. Track your progress and motivation levels. How does this shift in focus affect your behavior and mindset over time?
