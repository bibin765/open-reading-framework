## Five Thought-Provoking Discussion Prompts

1. **Modern Surveillance**: Given today's technology (smartphones, social media, facial recognition, data collection), are we living in a version of Orwell's surveillance state? How do the methods differ, and are the effects similar?

2. **Truth and "Alternative Facts"**: How does the Party's manipulation of truth and history relate to contemporary debates about "fake news," "alternative facts," and information warfare? What can 1984 teach us about protecting objective truth?

3. **The Power of Language**: Examine how Newspeak works to limit thought. Can you identify examples in modern politics or media where language is used to shape or restrict thinking? How important is it to preserve linguistic diversity and precision?

4. **Individual vs. State**: Winston's love for Julia becomes a form of resistance. Why do totalitarian regimes fear personal relationships and individual emotions? How do these private experiences threaten state control?

5. **The Nature of Power**: O'Brien tells Winston that the Party seeks power for its own sake, not for any greater good. Do you think this is realistic? How does this compare to how power is sought and used in democratic societies versus authoritarian ones?
