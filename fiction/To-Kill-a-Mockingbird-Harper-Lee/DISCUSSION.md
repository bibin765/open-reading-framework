## Five Thought-Provoking Discussion Prompts

1. **Moral Education**: Atticus teaches his children through example and conversation rather than strict rules. How effective is his parenting approach? What are the advantages and potential drawbacks of his methods? How do his lessons apply to raising children today?

2. **The White Savior Narrative**: Some critics argue that the novel presents a "white savior" narrative that centers white characters in a story about racial injustice. Do you agree with this critique? How does the novel's perspective affect its treatment of racism and the Black experience?

3. **Empathy vs. Action**: Scout learns to "walk in someone else's shoes," but how does empathy translate into meaningful action against injustice? Is understanding others enough, or is there a moral obligation to actively fight discrimination? What does true allyship look like?

4. **The Complexity of Characters**: Most characters in the novel are neither completely good nor completely evil. How does this moral complexity reflect real life? Consider Mrs. Dubose, Aunt Alexandra, or even Atticusâ€”how do their contradictions make them more realistic and the story more nuanced?

5. **Innocence and Experience**: The novel deals with the loss of childhood innocence when confronted with adult realities. Is this loss inevitable and necessary for growth? How can we protect children while still preparing them to understand and address the world's injustices? What is the balance between innocence and awareness?
